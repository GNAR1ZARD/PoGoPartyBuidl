## ‚ùó Input Validation and Error Handling

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: The application incorporates robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms to protect against injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). All user inputs are carefully validated against a list of valid Pok√©mon types and sanitized before processing. This ensures that only legitimate data is used, maintaining the security and integrity of the application.

- **Invalid Types**: If you enter an **invalid type**, the application will display an error message specifying which types are invalid. This helps you quickly identify and correct any typos or mistakes.

- **No Types Entered**: If **no types** are entered, an error message will prompt you to input at least one type to proceed with the analysis.

- **Input Format**: The application accepts types in a specific format to ensure proper processing:
  - **Capitalization**: Types are case-insensitive but will be normalized to have the first letter capitalized (e.g., `fire` becomes `Fire`).
  - **Separation**: For dual-type Pok√©mon, separate types with a comma (e.g., `Fire, Flying`).
  - **Whitespaces**: Extra spaces before or after type names are trimmed automatically.

By enforcing strict input validation and sanitization, the application not only enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback but also safeguards against potential security vulnerabilities associated with handling user-provided data.
